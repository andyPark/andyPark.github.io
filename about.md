Hey everyone, I'm originally from Raleigh, NC. I graduated in 2014 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill with a B.A. in Computer Science. I then spent (almost) five years of my life at Microsoft in Redmond, WA working as a software engineer on the Microsoft Office team. While I was at MSFT I worked on the Office extensibility team (essentially plugins for Office apps). I learned a lot at Microsoft from some really great engineers.

Now I'm back in Raleigh, NC and I am about to start a new job at Red Hat.

My interests lie in programming paradigms, database implementations, network optimization, etc etc (pretty much everything and the kitchen sink)

In my spare time, I like to read about technology, try to create new personal weight training records, and train my puppy dog, Yuna.
